Documentation for the JS AJAX functions (using pseudo-doxygen-style)

----------
Notation:
----------
@param my_param
    is used for parameters that must be passed to the function; eg my_funct(my_param)
    
@id [tag_type->subtype] my_id
    is used to define parameters that are needed, but should just be specified with an 'id' tag; eg <input type='subtype' id='my_id'></input>


----------
Comments:
----------
Generally functions should be called by using onClick='myFunction()' within a button that needs to trigger the functions

----------
Functions:
----------
authenticate_user(): log in as a pre-existing user
@id [input->text] username: the username of the user
